# Hand-Cricket-Android-application
## APP DESCRIPTION:
This app mimics the Hand cricket game with a player and a computer. First the
toss is computed and toss winner is decided. If user wins the toss he is asked to
chose “bat” or “bowl”. Otherwise, the computer chooses either one randomly.
Then the first Innings is played where the player will be provided with 6 buttons
and Computer generates a random number (1 to 6) each time. The score gets
summed up for the batter and if the computer generates the same value as the
button pressed by the player, the innings gets over. Both of them then switch
turns and the target will be set. The second innings is played similar to first
innings. If the second batter scores higher than first batter, he is declared as the
winner. Otherwise if the second batter gets ‘out’ before chasing the score of first
batter, the first batter is declared as winner. Otherwise the match is declared to
be tied.
